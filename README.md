# Goose Tracker
Small containerized application built from the ground up with Go and Vue.js. 

## Description
This application plots the last 7 days of Canada Geese spottings around Indiana. The size of the circles are proportional to the number of geese reported. 

## Architecture
This application uses a Vue.js frontend (really doesnt need it, it is just a svg html element that is modified using D3.js) which makes 2 http requests to a Go REST API built using Gin. The application is built using the docker-compose file, and is served on localhost:8080 using an nginx server.

# How to run the application
Running the application is simple. 

1. Clone this repo. 
2. Rename the `web-service-gin/.env.example` file to `web-service-gin/.env`
3. Replace the placeholder x's in the file with an eBird API key which can be generated by making an eBird account and going [here](https://ebird.org/api/keygen)
4. In the main repo directory run `docker-compose build`
5. Finally, run `docker-compose up`
6. The data visualization should now be visible by going to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
